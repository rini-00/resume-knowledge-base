# Frontend Validation

## **Single Command Execution**

```bash
# Terminal command to run this validation
npm run validate:frontend
```

## **Validation Prompt**

"Review and update the frontend workflow files (agent/ResumeLogger.jsx, src/index.css, tailwind.config.js, src/App.js) to meet all design system standards and functionality requirements. Ensure all four stages work properly (reflection, processing, review, success), responsive design works on mobile/desktop, and accessibility is implemented. Generate a simple test file that validates component functionality and provide a single npm command to run all frontend validation."

## **Expected Deliverables**

1. **Updated Frontend Files**:
   - `agent/ResumeLogger.jsx` - Complete component with all stages
   - `src/index.css` - Design system implementation
   - `tailwind.config.js` - Proper theme configuration
   - `src/App.js` - Clean integration
   - `package.json` - Added validate:frontend script

2. **Simple Test Implementation**:
   - Basic component testing
   - Stage transition validation
   - Responsive design check
   - Accessibility validation

3. **Terminal Output**:
   ```
   ✅ Component stages: All 4 stages functional
   ✅ Design system: Colors/fonts/spacing correct
   ✅ Responsive: Mobile and desktop layouts work
   ✅ Accessibility: Basic WCAG compliance
   ✅ Frontend validation passed
   ```

## **Success Criteria**

- [ ] All four user journey stages work
- [ ] Design system properly implemented
- [ ] Responsive on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Basic accessibility compliance
- [ ] Single npm command validates everything
- [ ] Clear feedback on any issues
