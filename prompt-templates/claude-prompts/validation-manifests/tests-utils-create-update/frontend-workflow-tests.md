# Frontend Workflow Tests - Simple Prompt

## **Single Command Execution**

```bash
# Terminal command to run these tests
test-frontend
```

## **Validation Prompt**

"Create simple frontend tests for the React component workflow. Build basic tests that validate the four stages work (reflection, processing, review, success), test user interactions like input and editing, and verify responsive design. Use simple testing approaches that work well for a personal project. Generate a zsh alias 'test-frontend' that runs all frontend tests with clear output."

## **Expected Deliverables**

1. **Test Implementation**:
   - Simple React component tests
   - Tests for stage transitions
   - User interaction validation
   - Basic responsive design checks
   - Mock API responses for testing

2. **Terminal Setup**:
   - zsh alias for 'test-frontend' command
   - Runs tests with clear output
   - Fast execution suitable for development
   - Minimal test dependencies

3. **Terminal Output**:
   ```
   Running frontend workflow tests...
   ✅ Stage transitions: All 4 stages working
   ✅ User input: Text input and validation works
   ✅ Edit functionality: Inline editing operational
   ✅ Responsive design: Mobile/desktop layouts
   ✅ All frontend tests passed
   ```

## **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Tests core component functionality
- [ ] Validates user journey stages
- [ ] Tests responsive behavior
- [ ] Single command runs all tests
- [ ] Fast execution for development use
- [ ] Clear feedback on component health
